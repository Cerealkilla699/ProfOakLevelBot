# ProfOakLevelBot

This is a Split tree level bot for discord which uses mariadb as a database and is coded in python. its pretty complex and i havent really done much as far as comments inside the code. Some parts are sort of messy as ive added a lot to it since i started. This bot features 3 role paths to follow. when one path is finished you pick your next, then that one is finished and you pick the final path. Each role path consists of 3 roles which need to be assigned. Its packed with features such as a leaderboard and rank command. supports slash commands also. if theres any questions find me on discord in this server - https://discord.gg/Z9RJSn55uC
